To compile L, just type `make' in the root directory. This should
build the executable and place it in the (newly created) `build/'
directory. You can then either run L directly by executing `build/l'
or copy l over to your favourite folder and run it from there.

L should compile on any decent GNU / Linux system, since it uses
nothing more than the standard C library, flex and bison. It may not
compile on a strict POSIX system, since it uses non-POSIX extensions
to flex and bison.

I did not use autofoo mainly because I found the additional bloat
unneeded; L does not have any hard-to-find dependencies. This may
change in the future; especially if I see the need to use additional
libraries.
